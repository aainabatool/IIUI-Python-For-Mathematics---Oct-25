# IIUI-Python-For-Mathematics---Oct-25

# Python for Mathematics â€” IIUI Seminar (Oct 25)
> **Delivered by:** [Aaaina Batool](https://github.com/aainabatool)
> **Audience:** BS Mathematics Students, International Islamic University, Islamabad
> **Goal:** Inspire mathematicians to explore programming, data science, and artificial intelligence using Python.

##  Seminar Overview
This seminar bridges the gap between **pure mathematics** and **modern artificial intelligence (AI)**.
Students will learn how their mathematical knowledge â€” algebra, calculus, statistics, and graphs â€” powers the intelligence behind todayâ€™s AI systems.
Through interactive examples and Python demos, weâ€™ll explore how mathematics **comes alive** through code.
